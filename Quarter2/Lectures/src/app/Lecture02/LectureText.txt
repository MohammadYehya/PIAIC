To create Route Groups we will create a folder with its name in round brackets
When calling a page in a Route Group, we dont need to specify the Route Group in the URL
Layouts can also be nested by creating another layout in a Route/Route Group.

To change from Server Side Rendering to CLient Side Rendering {by default Server Side Rendering}, we write 'use client'. This creates a client component.

To create dynamic segments{folders}, we will use square brackets []
Ex.
src/app
|->profile
	|->[name]
		|->page.tsx

page.tsx

export default (props:any) =>
{
	return (
		<h1>
			{props.params.name}{`'`}s Profile
		</h1>
	);
}

To generate Static Params we will use a built-in function
export const generateStaticParams = () =>
{
//	const names = ["okasha", "azfar", "bilal"];
	
	return [
		{
			name: "okasha"
		},
		{
			name: "bilal"
		},
		{
			name: "asfar"
		}
	];
};
this will optimized for these usernames as they are statically pre-generated.
