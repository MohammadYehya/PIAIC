First the instruction
        tsc --init              creates a config file related to typescript

Next instruction is 
        npm init -y             creates a package file

Next we download a package
        npm i @types/node -D    this allows us to use the module 'types' in 
our code and is not available in pure javascript 

Next use typescript to create objects

Next make json objects

You can link javascript files with each other in a HTML file using the syntax:
        <script src = "./name.js" />
        However this method is not desirable
