First install poetry.
    pipx install poetry (if pipx not installed then install it first)

To create a new project we will run 
poetry new Lecture01
Which ever folder you run this command in is now a python package

Before we do anything, we want to create a virtual environment
However poetry installs this in a rondom cache in the PC
Therefore we need to run this command to make sure that the env will be in the project
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

Then we go in the subfolder and run the command and create a venv
    poetry run python --version

To enter the venv, we simply run this command
    poetry shell
And to exit we simply write
    exit

Then add dependencies as such
    poetry add fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"

Now in the subfolder named as the main folder, we will create a main.py and populate it

The we will run the command to run the project 
    poetry run uvicorn lecture01.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
                                    OR
    poetry run uvicorn lecture01.main:app --host localhost --port 8000
And open the website {0.0.0.0:8000 may not work because of how IPv4 works}

For the documentation of the API just add /docs in the url
We can add /openai.json for the openai specification
